---Command blocks are only wrapped as peripherals if the `enable_command_block` option is true within the config.
---
---This API is not the same as the commands API, which is exposed on command computers.

function CommandBlock.setCommand(command) end


---Execute the command block once.
---@return boolean success If the command completed successfully.
---@return string reason A failure message.
