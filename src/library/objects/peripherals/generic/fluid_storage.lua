---Get all "tanks" in this fluid storage.
---
---Each tank either contains some amount of fluid or is empty.
---Tanks with fluids inside will return some basic information about the fluid, including its name and amount.

---Move a fluid from one fluid container to another connected one.
---
---This allows you to push fluid in the current container to another container *on the same wired network*.
---**Both inventories must be attached to wired modems which are connected via a cable.**
---@param toName string The name of the peripheral/container to push to. This is the string given to `peripheral.wrap`, and displayed by the wired modem.
---@param limit? number The maximum amount of fluid to move.
---@param fluidName? string The fluid to move. If not given, an arbitrary fluid will be chosen.
---@return number transferred The amount of moved fluid.
