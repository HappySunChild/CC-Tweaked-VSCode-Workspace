---This API is only available on Command computers. It is not accessible

commands = {}

---Execute a specific command.
---@param command string The command to execute.
---@return boolean success Whether the command executed successfully.
---@return string[] output The output of this command, as a list of lines.
---@return number? affected The number of "affected" objects, or nil if the command failed.
function commands.exec(command) end


---Asynchronously execute a command.
---Unlike exec, this will immediately return, instead of waiting for the command to execute. This allows you to run multiple commands at the same time.
---When this command has finished executing, it will queue a task_complete event containing the result of executing this command (what exec would return).
---@async
---@param command string The command to execute.
---@return number taskId The "task id". When this command has been executed, it will queue a task_complete event with a matching id.
function commands.execAsync(command) end


---List all available commands which the computer has permission to execute.
---@param ... string The sub-command to complete.
---@return string[] commands A list of all available commands
function commands.list(...) end


---Get the position of the current command computer.
---@return number x This computer's x position.
---@return number y This computer's y position.
---@return number z This computer's z position.
function commands.getBlockPosition() end


---Get information about a range of blocks.
---This returns the same information as getBlockInfo, just for multiple blocks at once.
---Blocks are traversed by ascending y level, followed by z and x - the returned table may be indexed using `x + z*width + y*width*depth + 1`.
---@param minX number The start x coordinate of the range to query.
---@param minY number The start y coordinate of the range to query.
---@param minZ number The start z coordinate of the range to query.
---@param maxX number The end x coordinate of the range to query.
---@param maxY number The end y coordinate of the range to query.
---@param maxZ number The end z coordinate of the range to query.
---@param dimension? string The dimension to query (e.g. "minecraft:overworld"). Defaults to the current dimension.
---@return commands.blockInfo[] blocks A list of information about each block.
function commands.getBlockInfos(minX, minY, minZ, maxX, maxY, maxZ, dimension) end


---Get some basic information about a block.
---The returned table contains the current name, metadata and block state (as with turtle.inspect). If there is a block entity for that block, its NBT will also be returned.
---@param x number The x position of the block to query.
---@param y number The y position of the block to query.
---@param z number The z position of the block to query.
---@param dimension? string The dimension to query (e.g. "minecraft:overworld"). Defaults to the current dimension.
---@return commands.blockInfo
function commands.getBlockInfo(x, y, z, dimension) end
