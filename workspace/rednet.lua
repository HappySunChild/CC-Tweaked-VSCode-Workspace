---Communicate with other computers by using modems.
---rednet provides a layer of abstraction on top of the main modem peripheral,
---making it slightly easier to use.

---@class rednet
rednet = {}

rednet.CHANNEL_BROADCAST = 65535 ---The channel used by the Rednet API to broadcast messages.
rednet.CHANNEL_REPEAT = 65533    ---The channel used by the Rednet API to repeat messages.
rednet.MAX_ID_CHANNELS = 65500   ---The number of channels rednet reserves for computer IDs. Computers with IDs greater or equal to this limit wrap around to 0.


---Opens a modem with the given peripheral name, allowing it to send and receive messages over rednet.
---
---This will open the modem on two channels: one which has the same ID as the computer, and another on the broadcast channel.
---@param modem string The name of the modem to open.
function rednet.open(modem) end


---Close a modem with the given peripheral name, meaning it can no longer send and receive rednet messages.
---@param modem? string The side the modem exists on. If not given, all open modems will be closed
function rednet.close(modem) end


---Determine if rednet is currently open.
---@param modem string Which modem to check. If not given, all connected modems will be checked.
---@return boolean isOpen  If the given modem is open.
function rednet.isOpen(modem) end


---Allows a computer or turtle with an attached modem to send a message
---intended for a computer with a specific ID. At least one such modem
---must first be opened before sending is possible.
---
---Assuming the target was in range and also had a correctly opened modem,
---the target computer may then use rednet.receive to collect the message.
---@param recipient number The ID of the receiving computer.
---@param message rednet.transmittable The message to send. Like with `modem.transmit`, this can contain any primitive type (numbers, booleans and strings) as well as tables. Other types (like functions), as well as metatables, will not be transmitted.
---@param protocol? string The "protocol" to send this message under. When using rednet.receive one can filter to only receive messages sent under a particular protocol.
---@return boolean sent If this message was successfully sent (i.e. if rednet is currently open). Note, this does not guarantee the message was actually received.
function rednet.send(recipient, message, protocol) end


---Broadcasts a string message over the predefined CHANNEL_BROADCAST channel.
---The message will be received by every device listening to rednet.
---@param message rednet.transmittable The message to broadcast. Like with `modem.transmit`, this can contain any primitive type (numbers, booleans and strings) as well as tables. Other types (like functions), as well as metatables, will not be transmitted.
---@param protocol string The "protocol" to send this message under. When using rednet.receive one can filter to only receive messages sent under a particular protocol.
function rednet.broadcast(message, protocol) end


---Wait for a rednet message to be received, or until `timeout` seconds have elapsed.
---@param protocol_filter? string The protocol the received message must be sent with. If specified, any messages not sent under this protocol will be discarded.
---@param timeout? number The number of seconds to wait if no message is received.
---@return number id The computer which sent this message.
---@return rednet.transmittable message The received message.
---@return string? protocol The protocol this message was sent under.
function rednet.receive(protocol_filter, timeout) end


---Register the system as "hosting" the desired protocol under the specified name.
---If a `rednet.lookup` is performed for that protocol (and maybe name) on the same network,
---the registered system will automatically respond via a background process,
---hence providing the system performing the lookup with its ID number.
---@param protocol string The protocol this computer provides.
---@param hostname string The name this computer exposes for the given protocol.
function rednet.host(protocol, hostname) end


---Stop hosting a specific protocol, meaning it will no longer respond to `rednet.lookup` requests.
---@param protocol string The protocol to unregister your self from.
function rednet.unhost(protocol) end


---Search the local rednet network for systems hosting the desired
---protocol and returns any computer IDs that respond as "registered" against it.
---
---If a hostname is specified, only one ID will be returned (assuming an exact match is found).
---@param protocol string The protocol to search for.
---@param hostname? string The hostname to search for.
---@return number? ... A list of computer IDs hosting the given protocol.
function rednet.lookup(protocol, hostname) end


---Listen for modem messages and converts them into rednet messages, which may then be received.
---
---**This is automatically started in the background on computer startup, and should not be called manually.**
---@deprecated
